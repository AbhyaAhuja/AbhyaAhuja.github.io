<p>Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available.
    They automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
    Examples of block-level elements include p, div, h1 to h6, and more. <span style="color: blue;">Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
        They do not create any space before or after the element.
        Examples of inline elements include span, a, strong, img, and more.
       </span> </p><p>This will start from a new line</p>
<span>But this and the link will be in the exact same line.</span> <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
